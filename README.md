# LibraryManagementSystem
📚 Library Management System
📌 Project Overview
The Library Management System is a console-based Java project developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It helps manage a collection of books, student records, and the process of issuing and returning books efficiently.

This project is ideal for beginners looking to practice core Java concepts and understand how real-world systems work.

💡 Features
📖 Add new books to the library

👨‍🎓 Add student members

📚 Issue a book to a student

🔄 Return a book

🔍 View available books

🧾 View issued book records

🛠️ Technologies Used
Java (Core + OOP Concepts)

Console I/O

Collections (ArrayList)

Simple file storage (optional enhancement)
